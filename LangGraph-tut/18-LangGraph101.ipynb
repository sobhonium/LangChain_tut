    "## ðŸ§  Key Concepts of LangGraph:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Graph Structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Nodes:** represent LLM calls, functions, or agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Edges:** represent transitions between nodes, determined by logic or LLM outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stateful Execution:\n",
    "\n",
    "LangGraph maintains shared memory/state, so nodes can access and update information across the graph.\n",
    "Useful for long-running reasoning, multi-agent collaboration, or iterative loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Control Flow:\n",
    "Supports complex logic: loops, conditional branches, parallel paths, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### You can build workflows like:\n",
    "\"If the user's question is about math, go to the MathAgent. Otherwise, go to the GeneralAgent.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-agent collaboration:\n",
    "\n",
    "Build systems where multiple LLM agents interact, hand off tasks, or debate.\n",
    "- Example: ResearchAgent â†’ SummarizeAgent â†’ CritiqueAgent\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ”§ Example Use Cases:\n",
    "Autonomous agents with memory and task management.\n",
    "\n",
    "### AI workflows like:\n",
    "Document QA: Upload â†’ Split â†’ Answer â†’ Summarize\n",
    "\n",
    "### Customer support flows\n",
    "Research bots that query sources, summarize, and validate\n",
    "Interactive tools where the system decides which agent/tool to use next.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ§± Built on:\n",
    "\n",
    "- LangChain (for LLMs, chains, memory, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "- NetworkX (Python library for graph operations)\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ§ª Why use LangGraph instead of plain LangChain?\n",
    "LangChain is linear (chain of steps), while LangGraph adds structure, control flow, and state, which is critical for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Complex reasoning\n",
    "- Multi-turn dialogues\n",
    "- Agent collaboration\n",
    "- Tasks with retries or conditional paths\n"
