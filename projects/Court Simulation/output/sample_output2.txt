arbiter: Alright, you guys are called as suspects here, after a rubbery in a shopping last night. I love to hear your points and stories. Go on.

first speaker: I'm shocked to be here, I was at home all night, I didn't even leave the house. I think you might be looking for someone else, like that guy over there who always seems to be around suspicious areas.

second speaker: I think that guy he's pointing out might be a bit of a weirdo, but I've seen him around the mall before, and I'm pretty sure he was with us when we went to the food court around 10 pm last night, so I don't think he's the one we should be looking at.

third speaker: I've been with my family all night, celebrating my sister's birthday at a nearby restaurant, and we even have witnesses who can vouch for my presence from 9 pm onwards.

arbiter: Can you (first speaker) confirm that you stayed at home all night and provide any contact information or alibis that can vouch for your presence?

first speaker: I can confirm that I was at home all night and didn't leave, and I have a few neighbors who can vouch for my presence. I'm pretty sure they'll remember seeing me playing video games until late hours of the night.

arbiter: Can you (first speaker) provide the names and contact information of these neighbors who can vouch for your presence, and when exactly did you last speak to them to confirm they'll remember seeing you playing video games?

first speaker: I remember seeing the third speaker arguing with a sales associate at the electronics store around 9:30 pm last night, and I'm pretty sure I saw them lingering around the store's exit after the argument, which seems suspicious to me.

arbiter: Can you (first speaker) clarify what you were doing when you saw the third speaker arguing with the sales associate at the electronics store, and did you happen to notice anyone else around during that time?

first speaker: I think I saw the third speaker glancing around nervously after the argument, almost like they were checking to see if anyone was watching, which made me feel uneasy at the time.

arbiter: Can you (first speaker) explain why you think the third speaker's behavior was suspicious and what specifically made you feel uneasy when you saw them glancing around after the argument?

first speaker: I'm starting to think that the third speaker's alibi about being with their family at a restaurant might be a bit too convenient, and I wonder if they might have slipped out for some reason around the time the rubbery went missing.

arbiter: Can you (first speaker) explain why you think the third speaker's alibi about being with their family at a restaurant might be a bit too convenient, and what specific details made you question their story?

first speaker: I think it's interesting that the third speaker didn't mention seeing us at the food court around 10 pm, considering we were all together and I'm pretty sure they would have remembered that.

arbiter: You mentioned seeing the third speaker arguing with a sales associate at the electronics store around 9:30 pm. Can you explain what specifically was being argued about, and did you hear any details about the conversation before you walked away?

first speaker: I remember noticing that the third speaker was wearing a new watch when I saw them at the electronics store, and I'm pretty sure they didn't have it on when we were all together at the food court earlier that night, which seems unusual to me.

arbiter: Can you (first speaker) explain why you think the third speaker's argument with the sales associate at the electronics store at 9:30 pm is relevant to the investigation, and what you think they might have been arguing about that could be connected to the missing rubbery?

first speaker: I think it's possible that the third speaker's new watch might have been a gift from someone, and I'm pretty sure I saw them glancing at their phone around 9:30 pm, which could have been a text from the person who gave it to them.

arbiter: After carefully listening to the statements from all three speakers, I believe that the first speaker is the most likely culprit.

Here's why:

1. The first speaker's alibi is shaky. They claimed to have stayed at home all night, but they couldn't provide any concrete evidence or witnesses to support this claim. They only mentioned a few neighbors who might be able to vouch for their presence, but they didn't provide any contact information or details about when they last spoke to these neighbors.

2. The first speaker is trying to deflect attention. By pointing out the third speaker's argument with the sales associate at the electronics store, the first speaker is attempting to divert attention away from themselves and onto someone else. This is a classic tactic used by guilty parties to shift the focus away from their own suspicious behavior.

3. The first speaker has inconsistencies in their story. There are several inconsistencies in the first speaker's story, such as their claim that they didn't leave the house all night, but then they mention seeing the third speaker at the electronics store around 9:30 pm. This lack of consistency raises suspicions about their credibility.

4. The first speaker is trying to read too much into the third speaker's story. The first speaker is trying to nitpick the third speaker's alibi and make it seem suspicious, but this is just a desperate attempt to discredit their rival suspect. The first speaker is doing this because they know that the third speaker has a solid alibi and they're trying to undermine it.

5. The first speaker is trying to create a smokescreen. By mentioning the third speaker's new watch and their possible connection to the missing rubbery, the first speaker is trying to create a diversion and distract from their own suspicious behavior. This is a classic tactic used by guilty parties to confuse and mislead investigators.

Taking all of these points into consideration, I believe that the first speaker is the most likely culprit. While it's possible that the third speaker might be involved, the first speaker's inconsistencies, attempts to deflect attention, and suspicious behavior make them the prime suspect.
